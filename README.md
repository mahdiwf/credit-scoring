# credit-scoring
AI-based credit scoring web application.<br>Skills: TypeScript, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.<br>

This project was a full-time paid internship where I was one of the backend and API developers. I developed a TypeScript program to transform images and Excel data as input to an AI model. I will not allowed to share the codes. I will only share some sample outputs.<br>

I think the dashboard is very user-friendly. When the user logs in, this is the first screen she will have. From this screen, the user will select any functionality she wants to perform.<be>
There are four features scoring.
* AI Identity Scoring: Based on the Document Verification, Location & Movement Analysis, and Digital Footprint
* AI Character Scoring: Based on the Character Analysis, Digital Footprint, and Credit Need & Purpose
* AI Capability Scoring: Based on the Legal & Permit Analysis, Constraint Analysis, Condition Analysis, Collateral & Guarantee, Capital Strength Analysis, and Capacity & Earning Power
* AI Credit Scoring: This functionality combines all the above scorings.<br>
