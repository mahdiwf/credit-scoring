# credit-scoring
Web based credit scoring application
This project was full time paid intership where I was one of the backend developer.
Since this is real project, I will not be able to share the codes. I will only share some sample outputs.

Dashboard: When the user login, this is the first screen she/he will have. There are four features scoring.
1) AI Identity Scoring: Based on the Document Verification, Location & Movement Analysis, and Digital Footprint
2) AI Character Scoring: Based on the Character Analysis, Digital Footprint, and Credit Need & Purpose
3) AI Capability Scoring: Based on the Legal & Permit Analysis, Constraint Analysis, Condition Analysis, Collateral & Guarantee, Capital Strength Analysis, and Capacity & Earning Power
4) AI Credit Scoring: All the above combined.
